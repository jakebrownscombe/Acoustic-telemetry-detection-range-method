# Acoustic-telemetry-detection-range-method

This repository contains R code and related datasets for the detection range correction factor outlined in:

Brownscombe et al. "A practical method to account for variation in detection range in acoustic telemetry arrays to accurately quantify the spatial ecology of aquatic animals" Methods in Ecology and Evolution

To utlize the code with example data, download all the included files, place them on your local machine, open the R worksheet and set the R's working directory to the folder where you placed the files
